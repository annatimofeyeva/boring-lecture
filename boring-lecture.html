    <p span class="about">About this Course:</span></p>
    <div class="Basic">
    <p><span class="Basics"></span>Storing, tracking and handling data is a large part of computer programming. Arrays provide a method for storing multiple values into a single variable. That makes an array a convenient way to pass around a list of items. In this course, you'll learn how to create arrays and use loops to access their contents. You'll also learn some advanced methods that make working with arrays easier.</p>

    <div class="Objects">Objects are a large part of JavaScript programming. In this lesson, we'll look at one part of JavaScript objects: using objects to store key / value pairs. Objects provide a flexible way to keep track of data by associating a name with a particular value. They're used all the time in JavaScript programming and, using a particular object format called JSON, they're used to transmit data between web sites, databases and web pages.</div>

    <div class="column">Loops are set of instructions used to repeat the same block of code till a specified condition returns false or true depending on how you need it. To control the loops you can use counter variable that increments or decrements with each repetition of the loop. JavaScript supports two loop statements: for and while.</div>
